It is highly modulized and based on [SDL Framework] (http://www.libsdl.org/), \r\nbut uses only **OpenGL** for rendering. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Cross platform developing on Windows and Mac OS\r\n* [Mit licence](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\r\n* Components oriented: you can use only modules that you want\r\n* Logging, common macroses, easy string formating (`boost::format` based)\r\n* Powerful **Point**, **Rect**, **Size** and **Color** classes that interact with each other\r\n* Many **interpolation functions** including physically reliable spring formula\r\n* **Intrusive lists** for fast collection manipulating without memory allocations \r\n* **Sprites** loading from common formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF) and drawing with scale, \r\n  transparency and color blending. One texture can contain many frames\r\n* **Fonts** loading from TTF format\r\n* **Sound engine**\r\n* **Particles engine**\r\n* **GUI framework**: collection of GUI widgets and GUI states for rapid interface development\r\n* Special `boost::shared_ptr` **delete strategy** that keeps \r\n  object destruction until `Update()` method finishes, but weak pointers become expired immediately. \r\n  It simplifies AI logic\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nFor more information and documentation, please have a look at the\r\n[project page](https://github.com/black-square/mango2d/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\n## Demos\r\n### GemsGame\r\n\r\nPuzzle game where you need to match three gems of the same color in a row.\r\n\r\n![GemsGame screenshot](https://raw.github.com/wiki/black-square/mango2d/img/GemsGame2.jpg)\r\n\r\n[More info and Mac/Win binaries links](https://github.com/black-square/GemsGame/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\n### TagGame\r\n\r\nGrid-based game where you need to decoy enemies to the traps but at the same time you need to avoid \r\nsituation when they touch the hero.\r\n\r\n![TagGame screenshot](https://raw.github.com/wiki/black-square/mango2d/img/TagGame.png)\r\n\r\n[More info and Mac/Win binaries links](https://github.com/black-square/TagGame/blob/master/README.md)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
