It is highly modulized and based on [SDL Framework] (http://www.libsdl.org/), \r\nbut uses only **OpenGL** for rendering. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Cross platform developing on Windows and Mac OS\r\n* [Mit licence](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\r\n* Components oriented: you can use only modules that you want\r\n* [Logging](Core/Log.h), [common macroses](Core/CommonMacros.h), \r\n  [easy string formating](Core/StrFormat.h) (`boost::format` based)\r\n* Powerful [Point](Core/Point.hpp), [Rect](Core/Rect.hpp), [Size](Core/Size.hpp) and \r\n  [Color](Graphics/Color.hpp) classes that interact with each other\r\n* Many [interpolation functions](Core/Interp.hpp) including physically reliable spring formula\r\n* [Intrusive lists](Core/TinyList.hpp) for fast collection manipulating without memory allocations \r\n* [Sprite](Graphics/Texture.h) loading from common formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF) and drawing with scale, \r\n  transparency and color blending. One texture can contain many frames\r\n* [Font](Graphics/Font.h) loading from TTF format\r\n* [Sound engine](Audio/)\r\n* [Particles engine](Particles/)\r\n* [GUI framework](Gui/): collection of GUI widgets and GUI states for rapid interface development\r\n* Special `boost::shared_ptr` [delete strategy](Logic/DefferedSharedPtrDeleter.hpp) that keeps \r\n  object destruction until `Update()` method finishes, but weak pointers become expired immediately. \r\n  It simplifies AI logic\r\n* etc.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
